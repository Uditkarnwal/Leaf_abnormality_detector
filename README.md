## Introduction
This project aims to detect abnormalities in the leaves of Indian-origin plants by using advanced machine learning techniques. The approach involves generating synthetic leaf images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and then employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify and classify leaf abnormalities.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of real and synthetic images of Indian-origin plant leaves. The real images were collected and preprocessed, and additional synthetic images were generated using GANs to augment the dataset.

## Methodology
1. **Data Generation using GANs:**
   - Implemented and trained GAN models to create high-quality synthetic leaf images.
   - Enhanced the diversity and size of the dataset with synthetic images.

2. **Leaf Abnormality Detection using CNNs:**
   - Designed and trained CNN models to detect and classify leaf abnormalities.
   - Optimized the models for accuracy and performance through iterative testing and validation.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Run the data preprocessing notebook to prepare the dataset:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb
     ```

2. **GAN Training:**
   - Train the GAN model to generate synthetic leaf images:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/gan_training.ipynb
     ```

3. **CNN Training:**
   - Train the CNN model to detect leaf abnormalities:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/cnn_training.ipynb
     ```

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained models and visualize the results:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/evaluation.ipynb
     ```

## Results
- The GAN model successfully generated synthetic leaf images, increasing the dataset size and diversity.
- The CNN model achieved high accuracy in detecting leaf abnormalities, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
